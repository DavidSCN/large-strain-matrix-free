Highlights:

- apply matrix-free approaches to finite-strain problems in solid mechanics
- propose and investigate different implementations of the finite-strain hyperelastic finite element tangent operator numerically
- propose a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ them to define a geometric multigrid preconditioner
- compare the performance of the matrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner to the matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid preconditioner for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous hyperelastic material in two and three dimensions.
