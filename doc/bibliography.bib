  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical multiscale modelling strategy for simulating fracturing in materials where the fine-scale heterogeneities are fully resolved, with a particular focus on concrete. The fine-scale is modelled using a hybrid-Trefftz stress formulation for modelling propagating cohesive cracks. The very large system of algebraic equations that emerges from detailed resolution of the fine-scale structure requires an efficient iterative solver with a preconditioner that is appropriate for fracturing heterogeneous materials. This paper proposes a two-grid strategy for construction of the preconditioner that utilizes scale transition techniques derived for computational homogenization and represents an adaptation of the work of Miehe and Bayreuther and its extension to fracturing heterogeneous materials. For the coarse scale, this paper investigates both classical -continuous displacement-based finite elements as well as -continuous elements. The preconditioned GMRES Krylov iterative solver with dynamic convergence tolerance is integrated with a constrained Newton method with local arc-length control and line searches. The convergence properties and performance of the parallel implementation of the proposed solution strategy is illustrated on two numerical examples.},

	Abstract = {The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development, integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries within an object-oriented framework for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scienti c problems. Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software. \par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking. \par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.},
