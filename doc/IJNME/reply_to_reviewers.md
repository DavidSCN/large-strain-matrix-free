> Minor editing is required in figures (axis titles).


> A uniform convention should be adopted for author names in the list of references.
The multiple first names were abbreviated the same way. This is the only non-uniformity we could find for the author names.

## Referee: 2

> In this paper, the authors develop a matrix-free method for nonlinear elasticity. The paper is very well written, both the methods (Alg. 1-3) and the numerical tests are convincing.

> Here are some minor remarks:

> 1. Eq. (4) on page 3:
>  a) The period "." is wrong. Please make a comma
>  b) And \forall \delta u reads strange wittout function space. I would write \forall \text{admissible directions } \delta u

> 2. To non-familiar Heidelberg-persons, IWR might be unknown. Please explain IWR on page 12.

> 3. Section 6: Out of curiosity: how many nonlinear Newton steps are required to solve the problem?

> 4. In the conclusions, I would specifically refer again to Alg. 1,2,3 and give some suggestions which Alg. 1 finally is prefererred and why.
> On page 16, just before Section 6.2, there are some suggestions. Are these the final conclusions w.r.t. the proposed Alg.?
