Novelty:

- development and roofline performance analysis of different matrix-free realizations of the finite-strain hyperelastic finite element tangent operator

- propose a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ them to define a geometric multigrid preconditioner

- performance comparison of the matrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner to a matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid preconditioner for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous hyperelastic material in two and three dimensions, showing that matrix-free methods are several times faster
