Novelty:

- propose and do performance study (using the roofline model) of different matrix-free realizations of the finite-strain hyperelastic finite element tangent operator

- propose a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ them to define a geometric multigrid preconditioner

- compare the performance of the matrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner to the matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid preconditioner for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous hyperelastic material in two and three dimensions.
